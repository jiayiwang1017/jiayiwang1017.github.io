I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.tamu.edu/) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Raymond Wong](https://raymondkww.github.io/). Prior to TAMU, I received a B.S. in Statistics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2017.


I am broadly interested in methodology and theory in nonparametric statistics and machine learning. 
My recent research focuses on statistical problems with complex functional data  or unknown  missing structures.
